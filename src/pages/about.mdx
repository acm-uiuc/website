## Who We Are

ACM @ UIUC is the Association for Computing Machinery student chapter, the world's largest scientific computer society. We are a group of dedicated people interested in exploring the possibilities of computers and discovering new ways to use them!

We're part of the international [Association for Computing Machinery](https://acm.org), the world's largest computing society, but we operate independently as a student-led organization focused on building community at UIUC.

ACM @ UIUC is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization through the Association for Computing Machinery.

## What We Do

ACM @ UIUC contains Special Interest Groups (SIGs), which focus on specific areas of computer science. Each SIG operates under ACM @ UIUC with autonomy over its meetings, activities, and purpose. Some SIGs are project-based, dedicating time to building something innovative or spectacular to showcase. Others focus on teaching, using talks and workshops to help members learn about a particular topic.

We also have committees—teams dedicated to supporting ACM @ UIUC or the CS@UIUC community as a whole.

ACM @ UIUC also runs various events throughout the year, such as ACM Open House, which showcases all the different SIGs at the beginning of each semester, [Reflections | Projections](https://reflectionsprojections.org), our annual computing conference, and [HackIllinois](https://hackillinois.org), which is one of the largest hackathons in the nation.

We also host a variety of outreach and social events, such as picnics, activity weeks, ACM Happy Hour, and our semesterly bar crawl. Our SIGs also run their own events! These events are open to all of UIUC, regardless of technical experience or background!
